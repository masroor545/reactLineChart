#Programming assumptions

1.We  created a file name data.json, we have placed given data.
As of now we have used directly for simplicity of application.

3.Break Points show you co-ordinates values, eg:x,y.
4.Layout is created based on responsive design.Please find attached snapshot for the same.
5.Extra task not implemented due to limitation of time. Will do this if you needed.
6.Basic test cases written.
